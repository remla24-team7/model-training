The lint scores will be shown here. The Before score it the score before code improvements are made and the after score
is the score after doing the suggested improvements.

Pylint scores with initial configuration:

make_dataset.py
Before: 0.00/10
After:  10.00/10

model_evaluate.py
Before: 6.82/10
After:  10.00/10

model_train.py:
Before: 4.86/10
After:  10.00/10


flake8 evaluation:
flake8 was run AFTER max scores with pylint was achieved.
flake8 was configured to follow same line length rile as pyline i.e. line of length 100 os allowed:
This tool gives no scores, so ill just show what issues showed up if they did.

make_dataset.py
no issues

model_evaluate.py
no issues

model_train.py:
Before:
model_train.py:16:24: E127 continuation line over-indented for visual indent
model_train.py:65:17: E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent
model_train.py:66:17: E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent
model_train.py:67:17: E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent
model_train.py:68:17: E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent
model_train.py:69:17: E124 closing bracket does not match visual indentation
After:
no issues

Bandit evaluation:
Bandit is run after flake8 shows no issues.

    Explanation by me: No fix is made here as there is no password or private information being stored. This can be
    seen as a false positive and can be ignored as an issue.

Final words: Having run three separate linters, and having no issue show up by any of them gives confidence in our codes
lack of code smells. There was an attempt to make dslinter work as it would show ML specific code smells, but this was
not possible due to an error which occurs while using an older version of pylint which is a requirement of dslinter
(the issue happens within the pylint library, so I am unable to fix it in reasonable time).
